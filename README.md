- Provides a better and customizable view when riding a horse/cart.
- Vertical Positioning: Moves the horse texture up/down depending on the camera's vertical angle. Intended to simulate visuals of the horse staying on the ground, rather than being attached to the center of your screen.
- Horizontal Positioning: Sways the horse texture left/right when rotating the camera left/right.
- Jumping/Falling/Landing: During jumps, eases the horse texture's position so it looks like the horse is jumping.
- Mod Settings: adjustable mod settings to tweak the visuals and dynamic behavior to your liking.
  - Can opt out of all dynamic positioning and just adjust the horse's position vertically and horizontally.
- Mod Setting Presets: comes with different kinds of mod setting presets for you to choose from.
